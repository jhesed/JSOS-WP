# JSOS-WP
Word Press version of Jesus Sovereign Overcoming Shepherd website.  
This site was re-written thrice:
(1) Python -- blazing fast! But no free web hosting for Python during that time
(2) PHP (CodeIgniter) -- however, the non-dev people were not able to update the website
(3) PHP (Wordpress) -- sacrificed speed for maintainability via CMS
