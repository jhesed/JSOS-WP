# JSOS-WP

<i>Word Press</i> version of <i>Jesus Sovereign Overcoming Shepherd website.</i> <br/> 
This site was re-written thrice:
  * <b>Python Tornado, MySQL, redis and ZMQ</b> -- blazing fast! But no free web hosting for Python during that time
  * <b>PHP (CodeIgniter)</b> -- however, the non-dev people were not able to update the website
  * <b>PHP (Wordpress)</b> -- sacrificed speed for maintainability via CMS
